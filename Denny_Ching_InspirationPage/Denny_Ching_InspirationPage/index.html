    <h4>April Greiman inspires me because she is known for exploring new technologies and 
    techniques in graphic design. Her work challenges traditional design norms and embraces 
    a more experimental approach. Her early adoption of digital tools and her innovative use 
    of them to create visually striking designs have inspired countless designers to push the 
    boundaries of what is possible in their own work.</h4>

    <h4>Ikko Tanaka inspires me because he merges traditional Japanese design elements 
    with modern aesthetics. He was skilled at combining traditional techniques, like 
    calligraphy and woodblock printing, with contemporary design concepts, creating a 
    unique and culturally rich visual language. Also his designs often featured bold geometric shapes, 
    clean lines, and minimalistic compositions.</h4>

    <h4>Molly Bang inspires me because she uses simple yet expressive illustrations 
    to tell complex and emotionally deep stories. Her books often address important themes and ideas in a 
    way that is accessible to young readers. Her distinctive artistic style combines bold shapes, colors, 
    and compositions to create captivating illustrations that capture the attention of both children and adults.</h4>
